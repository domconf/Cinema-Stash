# Cinema-Stash

## Description
Cinema Stash is an application made for movie lovers by movie lovers! Simply sign up or login and search any movies that you are interested in. Once the results appear, you can click to save the movie for later, where they will then appear in your saved movies tab. As you make your way down your list of saved movies, you are then able to remove them from your saved movies. If you are planning a movie night this is a great way to put a list together and keep track of which one you want to watch next!
